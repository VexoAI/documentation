# What is Vexo?

Vexo is a component library for PHP to help you develop AI-driven applications quickly.

It is heavily inspired by [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and builds on many of the same concepts.

The goals of the project are as follows:

* Create a complete collection of components focused on AI-driven applications
* Prioritize ease of use and simplicity
* Easy to extend and adapt
* Leverage the existing PHP ecosystem
* Connect to a wide range of models, data sources, and tooling
