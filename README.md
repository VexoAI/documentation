# Veco Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for [Vexo](https://github.com/VexoAI/vexo).

The documentation is built on [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [mkdocs-material](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## Development

Install `mkdocs-material` as such:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

You can now run a development server of the documentation:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
